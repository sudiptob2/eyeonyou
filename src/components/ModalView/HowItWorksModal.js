            <p>
                Eye on you is an AI based virtual co-working solution which
                helps you to focus on your work. EyeOnYou will use Machine
                Learning to detect your activity such as : movement of your
                face, hand, eye ect to determine your focus on the computer and
                notifies you if you loose your focus. As we do not send any data
                to the server and the processing is done on the client side so
                your privacy is protected.
